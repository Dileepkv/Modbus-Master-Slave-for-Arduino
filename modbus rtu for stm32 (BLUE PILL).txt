ModbusRtu_stm.h is the file based on ModbusRtu.h the changes that are done are the softwareserial.h
has been disabled so software serial will not work and the three USART is ther in BluePill (stm32f103c8t6) 
so default modbus uart is Uart 2 or Serial 2.
the example programs that forked from smarmengol/Modbus-Master-Slave-for-Arduino will work

i have used the BluePill (stm32f103c8t6) board and core is used Arduino_Core_STM32 link https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32
and the board version is 1.4.0 arduino ide v 1.8
